# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

    Ans) A stateful component involves stateful logic, that is to say, it interacts with and alters data in its functionality. On the other hand, a simple functional component does no such thing - it would typically only display data.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

    Ans) The componentWillMount function will be called upon mounting the component in question. A componentWillUpdate function is called whenever there is a change in the data associated with said component.

3. Define stateful logic.

    Ans) Stateful logic is the term used to describe when code interacts with and alters data in the functionality of a component.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

    Ans) Arrange, Act, and Assert are the three steps to a successful test. When arranging, you setup the initial conditions of what you're testing. When acting, you make a change to what you are testing to simulate the desired action. When asserting, you verify to see if the intended result occurs.
